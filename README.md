# EcoTherm Bricks: Thermal Insulating Construction Blocks from E-Waste

## 🚀 Problem Statement
India generates millions of tonnes of electronic waste every year, and traditional construction materials consume energy and increase carbon emissions. There's a need for sustainable materials that both reduce e-waste and improve building energy efficiency.

## 💡 Solution
We propose **EcoTherm Bricks**, made from:
- **E-waste plastic** (from electronic casings)
- **Shredded PCB powder** (non-metallic part)
- **Clay/fly ash/lime** as binders

The result: Thermal insulating, lightweight, low-cost bricks that reduce indoor heat and lower energy usage.

## 🔬 Features
- Low thermal conductivity
- Lightweight and cost-effective
- Utilizes toxic e-waste in a safe way
- Ideal for both rural and urban eco-housing

## 🛠️ Prototype Process
1. Collect and shred e-waste plastic and PCB
2. Mix with clay/fly ash/lime in different ratios
3. Mold and cure bricks
4. Test for:
   - Thermal conductivity
   - Strength
   - Water absorption

## 📊 Results (To Be Tested)
We aim to demonstrate:
- At least 30% reduction in indoor temperature
- Competitive compressive strength vs clay bricks
